love love love is in the air in the clouds
i love fall and spring and summer. i love the sun and the moon and the stars. i love the rain and the snow and the wind. i love the trees and the flowers and the grass.

##indie: 
# Locate I love you somewhere in teeth and eyes, bite it but take care not to hurt, you want so much so little. Words say everything. I love you again, then what is emptiness for. To fill, fill. I heard words and words full of holes aching. Speech is a mouth. (Robert Creeley)
